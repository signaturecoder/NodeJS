Start With Node.JS Fundamentals - 

Topics Covered - 

1. What is node.js? 
    -- NodeJs is a runtime environment run on server
    -- It run as Asynchronous Non-blocking i/o model 
    -- It is little different from the browser, we will not get document, localstorage in this environment
    -- It handles multiple threading very easily and fastly

    ** NPM 
    - It is node package manager 
    - It used to install/uninstall diffferent packages.


    Version Check :- 
    a. node --Version
    b. npm --Version

    How to make any folder as Node?
    --> We will use "npm init" command
    --> It will create one main folder - package.json 

    ** package.json -- it has all the package defined in this file
       package-lock.json -- it has dependency tree as it is

    let say, we want to install express - npm install express
    --> It will create one of the important folder in our directory called " node_modules " folder and "package-lock.json" file.
    --> node_modules has all the dependencies required in that particular project.

    ** dependency and devDependency -- install any package with --save-dev
    e.g npm install --save-dev nodemon


2. Why do we learn node.js?
3. How do we implement node.js in our day to day implementation?

4. What are modules ?
5. How many types of modules?
6. How to use different kinds of modules like CommonJS module, ESModule?

CommonJs Module 
= we need to export anything using keyword exports."key name" = <assigned_object/function>
= we can import in other file with the help of reuire() method

Module Wrapper Function - Below function is automatically wrapped by node.js to our 
= function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {}
7. What is fs-module, os module?

8. What is Events?
9. What are event loop?
